9, 2023\\n\\nWelcome to RivalFantasy. Rival Fantasy has three exciting offerings for the\\nNFL season: Challenges, Fantasy Bingo, and Season Long.\\n\\n**Challenge your Friends at Rival Fantasy Today >**\\n\\n## Rival Fantasy NFL: Week 10\\n\\n### **Challenges**\\n\\nWeek 9’s challenge ended abruptly when Josh Downs\\n\\nleft the game with a knee injury. For Week 10, let’s just hope both players\\nmake it out of the game without injury. We will try something new this week\\nand go with two running backs for our challenge instead of two wide receivers.\\n\\nThis week, I want to include Keaton Mitchell\\n\\nin a challenge. He was the top waiver add of the week, but his role remains\\nuncertain. His matchup is not ideal from a potential gamescript standpoint, as\\nhe will be facing a tough Cleveland Browns defense. Mitchell looked as\\nexplosive as he did at East Carolina and made good on all the offseason hype\\ncoming from local beat writers. Mitchell ran for 138 rushing yards and a\\ntouchdown on just nine carries. He should have earned an expanded role, but\\ngamescript concerns leave him in flex territory.\\n\\nDevon Achane\\n\\nwould be the running back I would pair with him if healthy, but since he is\\nnot an option for at least one more week, we will pick a struggling running\\nback and make this a real challenge. Alexander Mattison\\n\\nhas become the poster boy for not all volume being created equal and is well\\non his way to being replaced this offseason despite just signing a new deal\\nthis past free agency period. Mattison has scored zero rushing touchdowns and\\nhas averaged just 3.6 yards per carry through nine games this season. I am not\\nsure what Minnesota was thinking in letting Dalvin Cook\\n\\ngo. Perhaps his asking price was much higher than what he ended up getting\\nfrom the New York Jets. Whatever the case, Mattison has been a sub four yards\\nper carry runner for the last three seasons now and has failed to top 100\\nrushing yards in any game this season. This should make for an interesting\\nchallenge.\\n\\n### **Fantasy Bingo**\\n\\nWeek 9 wasn’t kind to my Fantasy Bingo cards despite upping my cards held from\\nfive to 10. I did manage to get three squares in a corner on one card, but the\\nachievement needed to complete the square was two first quarter touchdowns\\n(WR). I also had three squares of a horizontal line, with the missing\\nachievements being one fumble (TE) and two field goals missed (K). With my\\nluck not changing with the extra cards, I will be going back to five for Week\\n10. I did think twice since I will have Christian McCaffrey\\n\\nback in my lineup, but you cannot buy luck, and RNG will remain king.\\n\\nWe have some corner squares to monitor once again this week. The most\\nintriguing card to monitor has six to nine receptions (WR), more than 25\\nrushing attempts (RB), more than 200 total yards (RB), and more than 80\\nrushing yards (RB). The other potential corner square I will be monitoring\\ninclude 20-29 yard field goal (K), six to nine receptions (WR), more than 125\\ntotal yards (TE), and six to nine receptions (RB). There are some other\\ncorners with three achievements of note, but they are matched with one very\\nlow probability and very specific achievement as a likely roadblock.\\n\\nDifficult achievements included on my cards this week include two TDs rushing\\n+ one receiving TD + one passing TD (RB), three passing TDs in the second\\nquarter (QB), one rushing TD in the second quarter (WR), 25 rushing yards\\n(TE), 90 receiving yards (RB), zero field goals made (K), more than 50 rushing\\nyards (WR), one rushing TD and two receiving TDs (RB), 500 total yards (QB),\\n100 rushing yards (QB), five field goals made (K), two receiving TDs in the\\nfourth quarter (RB), one rushing TD in the fourth quarter (WR), three field\\ngoals missed (K), more than three sacks (QB), more than four passing TDs in\\nthe third quarter (QB), and more than four passing TDs in the fourth quarter\\n(QB). These, of course, are not the only challenging achievements, as there\\nare oddly specific achievements like the three passing TDs in the second\\nquarter littered across the skill positions. There are also more doable but\\nfar from a sure thing achievements like 125 receiving yards (TE), 150\\nreceiving yards (WR), and two TDs rushing plus one receiving (RB). These all\\nseem to be common achievements that have shown up each week.\\n\\nMy lineup for this week has some changes and a new strategy. Instead of going\\nwith two wide receivers and three running backs, I will be going with three\\nwideouts and two running backs. This may be a reaction to the choices at\\nrunning back or to Tyreek Hill\\n\\nand A.J. Brown\\n\\nboth being on bye. I will be going with Josh Allen\\n\\nat quarterback due to a plus matchup against the Denver Broncos and will be\\ntapping teammate Tyler Bass\\n\\n, as he should have plenty of field goal opportunities to both miss and make.\\nAt running back, I will be going with CMC and Alvin Kamara\\n\\n. CMC is a lineup mainstay, and Kamara has been a factor both on the ground\\nand through the air, which lends itself well to achievement chasing. At wide\\nreceiver, I will be going with some of the week’s top options in Stefon Diggs\\n\\n, CeeDee Lamb\\n\\n, and Amon-Ra St. Brown\\n\\n. Finally, at tight end, I have to decide between Mark Andrews\\n\\nand Sam LaPorta\\n\\n. I tapped LaPorta due to a more favorable matchup.\\n\\n**A Fantasy Sports Platform for Fantasy Players: Sign Up for RivalFantasy\\nToday!**\\n\\n**Subscribe** : **Apple Podcasts** | **Spotify** | **Google Podcasts** | **SoundCloud** | **iHeartRadio**\\n\\n_Raju Byfield is a featured writer for FantasyPros.

season is here, and the fantasy football playoffs are fast\\napproaching. Of course, with every team battling for the playoffs, we lose\\nsignificant players in their bye weeks. This week, we lose the Kanas City\\nChiefs, Miami Dolphins and Philadelphia Eagles fantasy studs, so navigating\\nthe crucial stats is an essential part of our Week 10 research that will help\\nus win. As we enter the final stretch of the regular season, every point\\ncounts, and it’s crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest stats and trends\\nto get the edge over your opponents.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll look at some standout statistics heading into Week 10\\nand how they can impact your fantasy football team moving forward. Whether\\nyou’re fighting for a playoff spot or looking to secure a bye week, the\\ninsights and analysis in this article will help you make the right moves to\\nwin your league.\\n\\n  * Waiver Wire Picks\\n  * Weekly Fantasy Football Expert Rankings\\n  * Fantasy Football Start/Sit Advice\\n  * Fantasy Football Trade Tools\\n\\n## 5 Stats To Know Before Setting Your Fantasy Lineup\\n\\n### **Kareem Hunt (RB – CLE)\\n\\nIs Inevitable**\\n\\nUsually, our titles are all song lyrics; however, with The Marvels coming out\\nand the Loki season finale on deck in my DVR, I’m leaning into a Thanos\\nreference. That is precisely what Kareem Hunt has been to the fantasy football\\nvalue of Jerome Ford\\n\\nthis season, as his inside the 5 totals have been inevitable (see now, you are\\nenvisioning the snap, too, right?)\\n\\nKareem Hunt is the fourth highest when it relates to inside the 5 rushing\\nattempt percentage in the ENTIRE NFL. He has played six games and didn’t even\\nstart on a roster to begin the 2023 season. With the Cleveland Browns, Jerome\\nFord has been pushed into the “Between the 20s” running back who needs a\\nhomerun shot to bring your fantasy team a ceiling play. Kareem Hunt is the\\nhammer that finishes off the drives for the Browns. With Deshaun Watson\\n\\ndealing with injury, the Browns will continue to lean on their running backs.\\nHunt should provide a “Walmart” version of David Montgomery\\n\\nwithin this Cleveland Browns offense.\\n\\n### **My Name isAlexander Mattison\\n\\nand There’s A Million Things I Haven’t Done**\\n\\nHonestly, just being able to write something that includes the hit smash\\nmusical Hamilton makes me happy, but Alexander Mattison has returned to\\nBellcow/ Volume King running back status. With Cam Akers\\n\\nsuffering another torn Achilles, we have a backfield that returns to the start\\nof the season with Alexander Mattison and Ty Chandler\\n\\n.\\n\\nHow did that break down the first few weeks of the year? In the first three\\nweeks of the year, Mattison received a snap percentage of over 73% in every\\ngame. He has seen a 61.8% snap percentage throughout the 2023 NFL season.\\nMattison also produced the fourth-highest expected fantasy points for running\\nbacks. It may not be pretty and you may not want to watch it progress, but\\nMattison can take over this offense. It’s an offense now without Cousins and\\nleaning on Joshua Dobbs\\n\\n. It’s the same offense that still needs Justin Jefferson\\n\\nto return. Mattison will have to play a role for this team in the coming\\nweeks. If you have sat him on the bench over the last few weeks, now is the\\ntime to allow Alexander Mattison to return to your starting lineup.\\n\\n### **We Found Love In A Hopeless Place**\\n\\nWe hope you have the Rihanna hit playing in your head like we do right now\\nwhile we write this section. However, let’s discuss Jordan Love\\n\\n. He was a hot commodity in the first few weeks of the season. However, since\\nthen, everyone has done their best to avoid Love and his offense in general\\n(minus Aaron Jones\\n\\n).\\n\\nDid you know Love has untapped potential due to drops within the 2023 NFL\\nseason? Jordan Love is second in the NFL with dropped air yards, only behind\\nthe reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes\\n\\n. Love has not been amazing, but he has not received the help he deserves to\\nflourish.\\n\\nThis week, he faces a Steelers defense that allows wide receivers to manhandle\\nthem across the board every week. Let’s break that down next.\\n\\n### **If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It**\\n\\nIn this article, We have explained every week that you want to target outside\\nwide receivers against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Here are the stats through the\\nentire 2023 NFL season:\\n\\nWeek 1: Brandon Aiyuk\\n\\n8 receptions/129 yards/2 touchdowns  \\nWeek 2: Amari Cooper\\n\\n7/90  \\nWeek 3: Davante Adams\\n\\n13/172/ 2  \\nWeek 4: Nico Collins\\n\\n7/168/2  \\nWeek 5: Zay Flowers\\n\\n5/73  \\nWeek 7: Puka Nacua\\n\\n8/154  \\nWeek 8: Calvin Ridley\\n\\n6/83  \\nWeek 9: DeAndre Hopkins\\n\\n4/60\\n\\nRomeo Doubs is up next with an 87.7 wide rate percentage. Remember to use him\\nif you have him. If you have Jayden Reed\\n\\n, he is useable as well this week. The Steelers also struggle in the slot, the\\nperfect example being Kyle Phillips\\n\\ndestroying them last week. We understand these two teams love to hit the under\\nin Vegas, but there are fantasy nuggets to be obtained within this game using\\nthe Green Bay Packers wide receivers.\\n\\n### **I Want To Fly Like A… Seahawk?**\\n\\nThe Washington Commanders defense is one we have been targeting all season and\\nwe can’t stop now in Week 10. The Seattle Seahawks stroll into this battle\\nwith a trio of talented wide receivers facing a defensive backroom that allows\\nthe second most receiving yards at the position. They have also allowed the\\nsecond-most touchdowns to the wide receiver position and the third-most\\nfantasy points per game to the position. We are still going, as this defense\\nhas the worst passer rating in the NFL when trying to cover wide receivers.\\n\\nThe same Commanders’ defense allows their opposition wide receivers to obtain\\nthe 12th-highest endzone target totals. Inside those targets, the Commanders’\\ndefense has allowed wide receivers the third-highest number of endzone\\ntouchdowns. When you combine all these stats with the fact that the\\nCommanders’ offense is running the second-highest neutral passing rate since\\nOctober, you create the perfect storm for fantasy points across the board.\\n\\nRemember to read all the fantastic work here at FantasyPros and reach out on\\nTwitter at @jpep20 if you need extra help.

@FantasyContext |  Nov 10, 2023\\n\\nWelcome to Sleeper Picks. Sleeper’s newest offering promised plenty of\\nentertainment and action, and they delivered. We will break down our top three\\npicks for this week’s NFL action. Sleeper is quickly becoming one of the most\\npopular season-long fantasy platforms, and they are expanding into other areas\\nbased on demand. Each week in this space, we’ll talk about some strategy for\\nthe new platform while providing our favorite NFL more/less picks.\\n\\n## **Sleeper Picks NFL Week 10**\\n\\n_Season record: 16-20_\\n\\n### **Alvin Kamara (RB – NO)\\n\\n: 34.5 receiving yards**\\n\\nAveraging 45.3 receiving yards per game this season, Alvin Kamara has been a\\nfocal point of the aerial attack with Derek Carr\\n\\nat quarterback. Kamara has averaged 42.8 receiving yards per game over his\\ncareer but saw a dip in consecutive years with Andy Dalton\\n\\nat quarterback. Now armed with an upgrade under Center and multiple weapons at\\nwideout to keep the defensive attention off him, Kamara is back to elite\\nreceiving numbers for a running back. Kamara has recorded 36 or more receiving\\nyards in four of his last five games and has topped 33 or more in five of six\\ngames this season. He is being peppered with targets regardless of opponent\\nand should be leaned on again in Week 10. Tap the More on Kamara for Week 10.\\n\\n**Pick: More**\\n\\n### **Amari Cooper (WR – CLE)\\n\\n: 50.5 receiving yards**\\n\\nAmari Cooper has been rock solid for the Cleveland Browns this season, even\\nthrough Deshaun Watson\\n\\nmissing games. He is Averaging 77.1 receiving yards per game, which is all the\\nmore impressive considering he had games catching passes from the likes of\\nDorian Thompson-Robinson\\n\\nand PJ Walker\\n\\n. Cooper has started to heat up in recent weeks, recording 89 or more\\nreceiving yards in three of his last four games and in five of his last seven.\\nThis week, he faces off against a stingy Ravens pass defense, but gamescipt\\nprojects to force the Browns to air it out. As a route technician, Cooper will\\nbe able to uncover enough to make some plays and set at just 50.5 receiving\\nyards; this is a play with too much value to ignore. Clap the More on Cooper\\nfor Week 10.\\n\\n**Pick: More**\\n\\n### **CeeDee Lamb (WR -DAL)\\n\\n: 79.5 receiving yards**\\n\\nCeeDee Lamb has caught fire for the Dallas Cowboys. With 117 or more receiving\\nyards in three straight games, CeeDee has upped his season average to 103\\nreceiving yards per game. He has seen insane volume over his last two,\\naveraging 15 targets a game. CeeDee has recorded 77 or more receiving yards in\\nfive of his eight contests this year and is an excellent bet to do so again\\nthis weekend. Lock in the More on CeeDee for Week 10.\\n\\n**Pick: More**\\n\\n_Writers note: The lines are constantly changing on Sleeper, so there is a\\nhigh probability that one or all of the numbers may no longer be the same when\\nyou open your app. There are excellent values when they are first posted, with\\nthe only catch being that they are not all released at the same time.\\nVigilance could provide a solid return on investment this season, literally._\\n\\n**Subscribe** : **Apple Podcasts** | **Spotify** | **Google Podcasts** | **SoundCloud** | **iHeartRadio**\\n\\n_Raju Byfield is a featured writer for FantasyPros.

Pepe  |  @Jpep20 |  Nov 10, 2023\\n\\nWelcome to Week 10 of the NFL season! As we approach the season’s midpoint, we\\nbegin to see rematches of division rivals, players returning from injuries and\\neven more bye weeks.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll look at some top performers you can use in Week 10 to\\ntake down a slate. With a slate as ugly as Week 10, we must find the games we\\nlike and hammer them into the ground to build leverage on the opponents. That\\nis why you will see a lot of stacks from the same game:  You can mix and match\\nthese players. You can build double and even triple stacks with a bring-back\\nplayer from our first two stacks.\\n\\nLet’s dive right in!\\n\\n## **NFL DFS Week 10 Stacking Advice**\\n\\n### **Washington Commanders**\\n\\n  * **Sam Howell (QB – WAS)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Terry McLaurin (WR – WAS)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Jahan Dotson (WR – WAS)\\n\\n**\\n\\nSam Howell has been on a tear this season. Howell is QB6 on the season and has\\nbeen a passing volume monster, with his team second overall in neutral passing\\nrate since October. Howells ranks first in passing attempts, second in passing\\nyards and first in the air yards this season.\\n\\nRemember, he also can be a mobile quarterback, which, if you follow these\\narticles, you know my love of Konomi-code level quarterbacks. The other\\nsignificant factor for Howell is the game narrative. He is a slight underdog,\\naccording to Vegas. This stat is crucial because it means his team must pass\\nto keep up/take the lead. We also know from past research that favorites, not\\nunderdogs, are more heavily rostered in DFS. You can grab yourself a strong\\nquarterback and build leverage with Howell.\\n\\nHis receivers, Terry Mclaurin and Jahan Dotson, are under $6K on DraftKings\\nthis week. That is a criminal price for both wide receivers, especially if\\nCurtis Samuel\\n\\nisn’t 100% or misses the game. McLaurin ranks 11th in deep targets and 37th in\\nred zone targets. He also sports a 19.3% target share in 2023. McLaurin has\\nseen eight or more targets in each of the last four games. He has averaged\\n12.6 or higher yards per reception in all of those games. Mclaurin is a player\\nthat the gameplan is built around and should be acknowledged within your pool\\nand inserted into lineups.\\n\\nJahan Dotson is Samuel-dependent. If Samuel plays, avoid Dotson. If he\\ndoesn’t, Dotson should continue to string together multiple good games for\\nyour DFS lineup. In the last two games, he has seen 18 targets and had a\\ntouchdown in each game.\\n\\nYou must use one of these three players (if not all) in Week 10. If you\\ninstead use them as a bring-back player for your lineup, let me show you below\\nhow to build the Seattle Seahawks side of this game.\\n\\n### **Seattle Seahawks**\\n\\n  * **Geno Smith (QB – SEA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **DK Metcalf (WR – SEA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Tyler Lockett (WR – SEA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR – SEA)\\n\\n**\\n\\nI enjoy Howell over Geno Smith. However, your contest will depend on your\\nquarterback. If you want to lean into cash, Smith is your play. If you want to\\ntackle a slate, Howell is your man. The Washington Commanders’ defense is just\\nsad. You can target them with any of these players and do well on your slat. A\\nlot of who you decide on will be salary-determined. However, my favorite order\\nin usage is DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and then Jaxon Smith Njigba.\\n\\nThe Commanders have the worst passer rating when defending wide receivers, and\\nthey allow the 12th-highest endzone targets and relinquish the third-highest\\nendzone touchdown rate to wide receivers. With Metcalf’s size, he fits our\\nheight/weight markers, enabling your team to break a slate. We may have been a\\nweek early on him last week, but Metcalf and his muscles should lead you to\\nvictory this week.\\n\\n### **Cincinnati Bengals**\\n\\n  * **Ja’Marr Chase (WR – CIN)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Bengals D/ST**\\n\\nThis section doesn’t need a plethora of stats. If Ja’Marr Chase plays, he is\\nalways an option in your player pool. If Chase plays and Tee Higgins\\n\\ndoesn’t, he is an automatic lock for your lineup against a team that could be\\nwithout Derek Stingley\\n\\n. Chase has game-breaking size and speed with the talent to dominate a slate\\nin one of the highest implied totals on the slate.\\n\\nAs for the defense, we should always reach for a slight favorite who will give\\nup an average amount of points. This allows us to build leverage. With how\\npoorly executed the Houston Texans run game has become paired with C.J. Stroud\\n\\n‘s struggles on the road, the Bengals’ defense could be the sneaky low-used\\noption you need for your lineup to takedown a slate in Week 10.\\n\\n### **Green Bay Packers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers**\\n\\n  * **Najee Harris (RB – PIT)\\n\\n**\\n\\n  * **Romeo Doubs (WR – GB)\\n\\n**\\n\\nLet’s start with Romeo Doubbs because we talked about this in my “5 Stats You\\nShould Know” article here on FantasyPros. Outside wide receivers destroy the\\nPittsburgh Steelers’ defense. Here are the statlines since Week 1:\\n\\nWeek 1: Brandon Aiyuk\\n\\n8/129/2  \\nWeek 2: Amari Cooper\\n\\n7/90  \\nWeek 3: Davante Adams\\n\\n13/172/ 2  \\nWeek 4: Nico Collins\\n\\n7/168/2  \\nWeek 5: Zay Flowers\\n\\n5/73  \\nWeek 7: Puka Nacua\\n\\n8/154  \\nWeek 8: Calvin Ridley\\n\\n6/83  \\nWeek 9: DeAndre Hopkins\\n\\n4/60\\n\\nDoubbs plays out wide at an 87.7% rate in 2023. Christian Watson\\n\\nis dealing with chest and back injuries. With Dobbs being the “big man” inside\\nthe red zone, we could see dividends on his stock immediately in this game.\\n\\nRecommending Najee Harris is like talking about Voldemort in Hogwarts; you\\nwill always get a look. However, Jaylen Warren\\n\\ncan’t keep Harris off the field, as Harris still has over 50% snap rates. Mike\\nTomlin loves to be a one-running back coach. This year is an uncomfortable\\ndeparture from his style, but he is still holding on with every bit of his\\nmight. Harris rewarded him last week with his best game to date in 2023. He\\nfinished as the RB12 with 16 rushing attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown.\\n\\nThis week, Harris faces the bottom-of-the-barrel Packers’ run defense that\\nallows the ninth-most fantasy points per game to the running back position.\\nHarris will give you a higher-volume RB with a low rostership percentage this\\nweek.\\n\\n  \\n**Subscribe** : **Apple Podcasts** | **Spotify** | **Google Podcasts** | **Stitcher** | **SoundCloud** | **iHeartRadio**\\n\\n_Remember to peruse all the fantastic work here atFantasyPros, and feel free\\nto contact me on Twitter at @jpep20.

FantasyPros Staff  |  @FantasyPros |  Nov 9, 2023\\n\\nWinning the trade market is at least as important as nailing the draft. Aside\\nfrom the waiver wire’s massive impact in the season’s first few weeks, trading\\nis the best way to improve your squad quickly. Great buy-low moves can set you\\nup for victory in the short term and down the stretch. Solid sell-high deals\\ncan get you big hauls for overachieving players who likely won’t sustain their\\nproduction.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at players to buy and sell this week. And be sure to check\\nout our weekly trade value chart with updated values for all players.\\n\\n**Check out the rest of our weekly fantasy football advice**\\n\\n_**Q: Who is your favorite buy-low trade candidate at this point in the season\\nand why? Also, who are you willing to give up for him?**_\\n\\n### **Justin Herbert (QB – LAC)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“Buy-low on **Justin Herbert**. Week 9 was unkind to Herbert as he only passed\\nfor 136 yards, but there are far better days ahead for the young phenom. The\\nJets were an elite, smothering pass defense, and rather than forcing the ball\\ninto tight coverage as Josh Allen\\n\\ndid, the Chargers opted to feed Austin Ekeler\\n\\nrepeatedly, taking advantage of average run defense. The time to upgrade from\\nTagovailoa or Stroud is now. Send out offers while Herbert’s value is at its\\nlowest.”  \\n– Aaron St Denis (The League Winners)\\n\\n### **Kyler Murray (QB – ARI)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“This is your last chance to get **Kyler Murray** on the cheap. He hasn’t\\nstarted yet, and many owners wonder if he will bounce back. Plus, the Arizona\\nCardinals look dreadful! Kyler has proved he can be a fantasy asset by having\\n3,700+ yards passing three of the last four years (ACL injury prevented last\\nyear) and 400+ yards rushing every year he has been in the league! He could be\\nthe piece you need for a team that drafted a quarterback early who is injured\\nor disappointing and could be had for a package of a WR2 like Diontae Johnson\\n\\n, Jahan Dotson\\n\\n, and/or RB2 like James Cook\\n\\nor Jerome Ford\\n\\nin single QB leagues if the owner who was holding him is willing to part with\\nhim.”  \\n– Adam Dove (The Fantasy Couriers)\\n\\n### **Marquise Brown (WR – ARI)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**Marquise Brown** has been the WR41 over the past four weeks, averaging 7.1\\nhalf-point PPR fantasy points per game, scoring fewer than 6.5 in all but one\\ncontest. However, the veteran had scored at least 13.1 fantasy points in four\\nconsecutive games before the cold streak. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray\\n\\nis on track to play in Week 10. More importantly, Brown is Arizona’s clear-cut\\nNo. 1 weapon, seeing 34 more targets than any other Cardinal this season. Last\\nyear, the former Oklahoma star averaged 13.7 fantasy points per game and had a\\n26% TPPR (per Fantasy Points Data) with Murray under center. I would flip\\nJakobi Meyers\\n\\nfor Brown in a heartbeat.”  \\n– Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros)\\n\\n### **Tony Pollard (RB – DAL)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“At this point, it’s still **Tony Pollard**. He might not be as efficient\\ncoming off the leg injury and getting a bigger workload, but it’s offset by a\\nbigger workload. He also has plenty of positive TD regression coming his way.\\nI’d be willing to give up any of Kenneth Walker III\\n\\n, D’Andre Swift\\n\\n, Adam Thielen\\n\\n, or T.J. Hockenson\\n\\nto get Pollard.”  \\n– Robert Norton (Last Word On Sports)\\n\\n“**Tony Pollard** may have scored a ridiculously unsustainable 9 of his 12\\ntouchdowns in 2022 from 10 or more yards from the end zone. But it isn’t fair\\nto call his two months without a score in 2023 negative regression. The new\\nCowboys starter has seen new opportunities to score without Ezekiel Elliott\\n\\nin Dallas. But Pollard has been insanely unlucky to score just twice despite\\ntop three totals of 33 red zone carries and 10 carries inside the 5-yard line.\\nI expect Pollard to rebound and score four or more touchdowns in the second\\nhalf of the season, and I would try to trade potentially declining fantasy\\nassets like Saquon Barkley\\n\\nand Jordan Addison\\n\\nfor him.”  \\n– Scott Spratt (FTN)\\n\\n### **De’Von Achane (RB – MIA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“While some might suggest that a big-name player like **De’Von Achane** cannot\\nbe a buy-low candidate, I will push back. He has a bye week this week, and\\nsome fantasy managers cannot afford another loss (no matter what their plan\\noriginally was in terms of waiting on Achane). Given he is a top 5RB in my\\neyes, yet can be had well outside of the top 5 RB value, well, that’s a buy-\\nlow in my eyes. It’s just a big-name buy-low. Selling combos of Josh Jacobs\\n\\n, Joe Mixon\\n\\n, Adam Thielen\\n\\n, Amari Cooper\\n\\nis advised.”  \\n– Smitty (TheFantasyFootballShow)\\n\\n“**De’Von Achane** exploded onto the scene and compiled over 100 points in\\njust three weeks. He is just weeks away from returning, and the time to buy is\\nnow. Take advantage of an impatient owner and go stash Achane. Ask yourself\\nthis question. When the fantasy football playoffs come around, do I want\\nAchane on my team, or do I want to be facing him? Go get Achane!”  \\n– David Heilman (Sports Gambling Podcast Network)\\n\\n### **DeAndre Hopkins (WR – TEN)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“I’ve seen a lot of fantasy analysts advising folks to sell high on **DeAndre\\nHopkins** as a one-game wonder, but I think that might be a mistake. The\\nTitans’ schedule looks pretty good overall, especially weeks 15, 16, & 17,\\nwhich are Houston, Seattle, and Houston, respectively. Hell, that’s almost as\\ngood as my incredible jokes, haha! There could be some major shootouts during\\nthe fantasy playoffs, and Hopkins will be plenty motivated to stick it to his\\nold team. It wouldn’t shock me if he says something to QB Will Levis\\n\\nlike, “The Texans are mine; just throw me the ball, rook, and I’ll take care\\nof the rest.” Who am I willing to give up for DeAndre Hopkins? Garrett Wilson\\n\\n, Diontae Johnson\\n\\n, George Pickens\\n\\n, Zay Flowers\\n\\n, or Jakobi Meyers\\n\\n.”  \\n– Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts)\\n\\n### **DK Metcalf (WR – SEA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**DK Metcalf** is a great buy-low player right now. He has been under ten\\nfantasy points in three of the last four weeks. It’s tough to buy into the\\nSeattle passing attack due to how bad it has been. On the field, he continues\\nto lead this team in targets. He has a big play ability that will get loose at\\nsome point. Seattle receivers have the fifth easiest remaining schedule in\\nfantasy football. I’d expect Metcalf to be about to bounce back in the second\\nhalf of the season. I’d look to sell off Jaydlen Waddle and get Metcalf Plus\\nin a trade. ”  \\n– Steven Pintado (The Fantasy Coaches)\\n\\n### **Justin Madubuike (DT – BAL)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“Defensive tackle **Justin Madubuike** has burst onto the IDP scene this\\nseason and is currently the DL8 on the season. The best part is that\\nMadubuike’s points aren’t just from one or two games, and his points have been\\nquite consistent this season, only having one game finished this season under\\neight fantasy points. Eight sacks on the season, Madubuike is on a six-game\\nsack streak and always adds in a few tackles to sweeten up his fantasy points.\\nI believe a solid LB2/Flex option would get the deal done, and in dynasty\\nformats, start the conversation with a 2024 fourth-round pick.”  \\n– Mason “Mase” Riney (Fantasy Six Pack)\\n\\n_**Q: Who is your favorite sell-high candidate at this point in the season and\\nwhy? Also, who would you try to get in return?**_\\n\\n### **C.J. Stroud (QB – HOU)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“My sell-high is **C.J. Stroud**. Don’t get me wrong, Stroud is excellent.\\nThis sell-high is about his value currently. Today, I saw Stroud traded\\nstraight up for Burrow. In a dynasty league, I not only saw a manager give up\\nJoe Burrow\\n\\nto acquire Stroud, but they threw in a third-round pick for good measure.\\nWhile Stroud has been great, he is clearly due for some regression. Cash out\\nnow and trade him to a panicked manager with a struggling top-6 quarterback\\nsuch as Burrow, Jackson, or Stroud.”  \\n– Aaron St Denis (The League Winners)\\n\\n“There seemed to be a healthy skepticism when Will Levis\\n\\nthrew four touchdowns in his debut but threw them from 16, 33, 47 and 61 yards\\nfrom the end zone, distances that netted him a 3.88 expected touchdown surplus\\nthat is the most by a quarterback in a game this season and that suggested a\\nlikely regression in future weeks. But **C.J. Stroud** threw his five Week 9\\ntouchdowns from a similar 9, 14, 15, 29, and 75 yards from the end zone and\\nnetted a 3.72 expected touchdown surplus, and I sense the public is ready to\\nmake the Texans rookie a slam-dunk top eight quarterback the rest of the\\nseason. I buy Stroud as a franchise quarterback, but I don’t think he is sure\\nto be more productive than Trevor Lawrence\\n\\nor Jared Goff\\n\\nfor the rest of 2023. And if you had an alternative at the position, I would\\nsee if you could trade Stroud high for a less popular player like Chris Godwin\\n\\nor George Pickens\\n\\n.”  \\n– Scott Spratt (FTN)\\n\\n### **Gus Edwards (RB – BAL)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“The “Gus Bus” has been running on TDs recently! **Gus Edwards** has scored\\ntouchdowns each of the last three weeks, with three in Week 8 and two in Week\\n9. That being said, his carries went down to 5 in Week 9 as rookie Keaton\\nMitchell\\n\\ntook the spotlight. Sell Gus on touchdowns for a running back with more volume\\n(Isiah Pacheco\\n\\n, Rashaad White, Alexander Mattison\\n\\n) before he becomes solely a TD vulture.”  \\n– Adam Dove (The Fantasy Couriers)\\n\\n“**Gus Edwards** has been on fire lately. He is the RB1 over the past three\\nweeks, averaging 22.2 half-point PPR fantasy points and two rushing touchdowns\\nper game. However, over 54% of his fantasy production came from the six\\nrushing touchdowns. Meanwhile, the veteran averaged only 6.5 fantasy points\\nper game over the first six contests. He had more than six fantasy points only\\nonce, in the Week 2 matchup where Edwards found the end zone. The veteran\\nrunning back is a touchdown-or-bust player, and Keaton Mitchell\\n\\ncould start cutting into his workload. Furthermore, his rest of the season\\nschedule isn’t fantasy-friendly. Try to flip Edwards and a WR3 for Kenneth\\nWalker or Tony Pollard\\n\\n.”  \\n– Mike Fanelli (FantasyPros)\\n\\n### **Raheem Mostert (RB – MIA)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**Raheem Mostert** feels like the low-hanging fruit here. Selling high last\\nweek was probably the best move as he’s now entering the bye week, and De’Von\\nAchane\\n\\nis likely returning in Week 11, so the return might not be there. I’d rather\\nhave DJ Moore\\n\\n, Diontae Johnson\\n\\n, Tyler Lockett\\n\\n, or Zay Flowers\\n\\n, assuming you need WR help.”  \\n– Robert Norton (Last Word On Sports)\\n\\n### **Saquon Barkley (RB – NYG)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“One player I recommend selling high right now is **Saquon Barkley**. He keeps\\ngetting hurt, even if he finds a way back onto the field. He also plays in an\\nawful offense, and he’s asked to do too much with very little to work with,\\nwhich is a recipe for injury all on its own (even for an RB that doesn’t have\\na huge risk of injury). Sell him across position to maximize value, as many\\nwill overpay for an RB right now. Think Cooper Kupp\\n\\n, Puka Nacua\\n\\nand Davante Adams\\n\\n.”  \\n– Smitty (TheFantasyFootballShow)\\n\\n### **Ja’Marr Chase (WR – CIN)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“TIE… RB **Saquon Barkley** and **Ja’Marr Chase**. I’m offering a Ringo fall\\nspecial- two great predictions and some hysterical jokes from a fantasy/comic\\nlegend for one low price. Okay, two lousy predictions and the usual lame jokes\\nfrom yours truly for one low price, haha. The Giants’ offense is in major\\ntrouble with Daniel Jones\\n\\nout for the year, and yet, somehow, Saquon is still relatively high on several\\ntrade value charts I’ve looked at. Yes, I know about Saquon’s volume, but what\\nseparates a championship fantasy lineup from the runner-up are TDs, and the\\nGiants will struggle to score. As for Chase, he was in severe pain during that\\nBills’ game, and back injuries usually feel worse afterward. The idea of my\\nstar WR, with a shaky back, getting blasted by defenders every time he gets\\nthrown a pass doesn’t inspire much confidence. Who would I try to get in\\nreturn for Saquon Barkley? RB Derrick Henry\\n\\nand TE Taysom Hill\\n\\nor RB Derrick Henry\\n\\nand WR DeAndre\\n\\nHopkins. Who would I try to get in return for Ja’Marr Chase? The same players\\nI listed above in the Saquon deal, or if that wasn’t possible, maybe a one-\\nfor-one swap for Travis Kelce\\n\\nor Cee Dee Lamb.”  \\n– Mark Ringo (Sleepers and Busts)\\n\\n### **Josh Jacobs (RB – LV)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**Josh Jacobs** is coming off his second-best game of the season in week\\nnine. While Jacobs has had more success, he still runs at 3.2 YPC. I can’t\\nimagine the team competing with a rookie quarterback. Jocabs has the sixth-\\nhardest remaining schedule of the season for fantasy running backs. Let’s not\\nforget he still has a bye week to deal with. I’d be looking to sell high on\\nJacobs to acquire like De’Von Achane or Tony Pollard\\n\\n.”  \\n– Steven Pintado (The Fantasy Coaches)\\n\\n### **Tank Dell (WR – HOU)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**Tank Dell** blew up this weekend, and unfortunately, the points were wasted\\non a lot of benches. Just remember why he was on so many benches. Dell had\\njust 18.3 points in his last three games. C.J. Stroud\\n\\nlooked great, but five touchdown games with 470 yards passing don’t come\\naround too often. Pair Dell up with another WR or RB and tier up. Don’t get\\ncaught up chasing points from last week.”  \\n– David Heilman (Sports Gambling Podcast Network)\\n\\n### **Drue Tranquill (LB – KC)\\n\\n**\\n\\n“**Drue Tranquill** is someone I am willing to ship off of my roster to a team\\nin need of a linebacker. He didn’t have the hottest start to the season, but\\nsince Week 3, he has been very efficient for fantasy managers, scoring over 11\\nfantasy points for six consistent weeks(WK3-WK8). Tranquill is a player who is\\nalso sent a few times a game to pressure the quarterback and has four sacks on\\nthe season to show for his efforts in pass rushing. Not to mention, Tranquill\\nwill see the field more than any other Kansas City linebacker, with fellow\\nlead linebacker Nick Bolton\\n\\ncurrently on injured reserve until Week 16. I would attempt to trade for a DL2\\ntype of player or, in dynasty, get a fourth or third-round future pick in\\nreturn. ”  \\n– Mason “Mase” Riney (Fantasy Six Pack)\\n\\n**Subscribe** : **Apple Podcasts** | **Spotify** | **Google Podcasts** | **SoundCloud** | **iHeartRadio**\\n\\nFeatured Pros NFL Trade Advice Justin Herbert Josh Allen Austin Ekeler Kyler\\nMurray Diontae Johnson Jahan Dotson James Cook Jerome Ford Marquise Brown\\nJakobi Meyers Tony Pollard Kenneth Walker III D’Andre Swift Adam Thielen T.J.\\nHockenson Ezekiel Elliott Saquon Barkley Jordan Addison De’Von Achane Josh\\nJacobs Joe Mixon Amari Cooper DeAndre Hopkins Will Levis Garrett Wilson George\\nPickens Zay Flowers DK Metcalf Justin Madubuike C.J.
